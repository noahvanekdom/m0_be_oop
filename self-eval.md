# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?  

**Felt really good. I definitely did not remember close to everything I needed to, which forced me to find some really helpful resources. I got stuck a few times, took a break, came back and each time was able to make progress. Synthesizing all of the small things we've learned into something that has clear utility is a hugely motivating feeling.**  

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?  

**My workflow feels good, I'm noticing that I'm avoiding a lot of the issues I've had in my past job managing campaigns, where it feels impossible to get back into the right mindset once you've left it because of how many spinning plates there are. Here I can just put everything down and let my subconscious break down the problem for a bit.**  

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?  

**NEXT WEEK? Just kidding. I feel pretty ready, I need to figure out a way to take less time cooking during the day, or a way to make that time more productive. Sticking to my early rising time is important, which means setting a hard and fast bedtime and scheduling to make sure I can meet it.**
